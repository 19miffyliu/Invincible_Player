# Invincible_Player

# Introduction

This is an invincibility mod I wrote for modding purpose. 

If you are a modder who:
- are tired of getting killed randomly
- just want to test some feature in a safe environment

Then this mod is for you!

**Beware:** bugs will certainly appear as the game do not expect you to be invincible in the facility.

# Description
You are now:
- Immune to all kinds of damage/instadeath event like when you're in orbit.
- The kill animation of each monster can still be enabled in the config. 

# Compatibility
## This mod is compatible with:
- Any mod that does not tweak enemy collision.


# Bug Reporting

Please report bugs at [Github Issues Page](https://github.com/19miffyliu/Invincible_Player/issues).

## Known Bugs

- The kill animation will trap the player in place (can't move, can't interact).
- The masked will keep duplicating the player if kill animation is enabled.
- The player may get trapped below the cliff of the facility if they fall.

# Update

1.0.0: Updated Readme.

# Config Options

## Monster Kill Animation

**Enabled:** The monster will play their kill animation if they touch you. You may get trapped in their grasp like in vanilia gameplay. There's nothing I can do about that.

Included monsters:
- Masked
- Jester
- Baboon bird
- Bracken
- Snare Flea
- Giant

**Disabled(default):** The monster will still chase you, but they will not play kill animation. Nothing will happen if they touch you.
